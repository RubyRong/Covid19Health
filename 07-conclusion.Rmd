main results: In summary, our research suggests a close relation between high vaccination rates and low COVID-19 confirmation rates, a counter-intuitive negative relationship between bed occupation rates and COVID-19 confirmation rates and weak impacts of sufficiency of resources and nursing staff at the current stage. We also provide further evidence or explanations to phenomena above.

limitations: 

future directions: To expand this research, we propose the following aspects: 

lessons learned: From the perspective data science experience, we have learned that data is helpful for providing insights and evidence, but it is important to reflect on reality or resort to scientific experiments before coming to conclusions.
