[["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We used the data set of confirmed cases of all nursing houses around the nation. There are 91892 rows in the data set. According to the missing value plots shown above, We can clearly see that there arenâ€™t many rows which have lots of missing values. The number of the row pattern which has the most missing values is quite small, compared with the complete case row. The numbers of all other row patterns are also very small. This makes our preprocessing step much easier and means that the missing value will not harm our decision that much. The top four columns which have the most missing values(T.R.C, T.R.CO, N, T.N) are Total Residents Confirmed Cases, Total Residents Covid-19 Death, Number of All Beds, Total Number of Occupied Beds. They are all numerical values. All other columns which have missing values are also numerical values. Because we will analyze nursing houses by state. Thus, we will replace all missing values of a column by the average of other values which are in the same state.
